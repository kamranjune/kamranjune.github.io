# BAMazon -- Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

Trying some Markdown Here.  Right Click Preview in VS Code for Best Display.  This is the basic edition of BAMazon.   
Where Inquirer and MySQL modules/packages are used to allow shopping on server side comand prompts for all 
programs who cannot break away from their lives on command line!  I did the basic edition but there were some
interesting observations as to how the code ended up working.  I followed all the instructions but added a 
before and after Quantity Tally, rather than doing the bonus items.  I need to spend more time on other parts of the class
rather than developing Inquirer skills.  The Inquirer docs were not very clear and had broken links, which leads to 
the old adage, "An API/Module etc is only as good as its Docs!"

I tried a spiffy Readme Markdown file:
* "Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading.

[click here for a rundown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), or just take a look at the raw file of these instructions."
