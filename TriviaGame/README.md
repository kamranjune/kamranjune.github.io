Interesting Note:  Everything was put inside the setInterval function 
and the done button was simply changed to set the timer to 0 when clicked.

I did this because I was not sure if the clearInterval function would work 
outside the setInterval function because of lexical scope.  However, I looked 
at other people's code and I noticed that they used the clearInterval function
outside setInterval, so it works.

A link to the Google Chrome Dinosaur game was added just for fun.  This is the game 
that normally plays when there is no internet access for Chrome, which is 
played using the spacebar to jump.   I appended this section and prepended the results
section before just to get practice.
