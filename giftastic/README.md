GIFtastic!

This app hits the GIPHY API and populates topics in the embeded array picked by the author and lets the user add topics to add gifs.

User can use the enter key rather than clicking the button to add a Gif.

Lexical scope is challenging with this program because the ajax call had to be repeated in the addGifButton in order for the Gif to be generated after a new topic was added.
